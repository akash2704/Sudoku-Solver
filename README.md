# Sudoku-Solver
This a python program solved using Backtracking and reccursion concepts.
* Backtracking: Backtracking involves inserting a possible number in the nearest empty box and going to the next unsolved box. This will go on until we run into an error and we place a zero in the box. We move to the previously solved box and try the next possible number to solve it. 
* Recursion: Recursion involves calling a function within a function. You will come to understand this when we need to call the function several times to solve an unknown number
